# orbital

hello
  
welcome to orbital, version 1 (alpha) by 1505 

orbital is an experiment in simple sequences and interface design
it was created to learn lua scripting for norns
it is very much a work in progress

the code is messy, the capability small
orbital has a roadmap, the things still to do are...

- move trig calculations into external class
- add ability to change sequence length
- add up to 4 sequences
- test out different engines / using samples
- possibly change the name
- get saving and loading of sequence data into an external file

only then will orbital be considered release 1

please comment, suggest, tell me where the code is a mess

enjoy
