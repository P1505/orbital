# orbital

hello
  
welcome to orbital, version 1.1 by 1505 

orbital is an experiment in simple sequences and interface design
it was created to learn lua scripting for norns
it is very much a work in progress

the code is messy, the capability small

orbital has a roadmap, the things still to do are...
  - add ability to stop circles independantly
  - get loading and saving of sequence data into an external data file
  
  and bugs to fix...
   - add variety to note circle sizes - more of a UI improvement than a bug

please comment, suggest, tell me where the code is a mess

enjoy

## how do you use this?

copy the "1505" folder to code using SFTP (excellent guide here: https://monome.org/docs/norns/sftp/) or if you prefer use maiden to copy and paste the code over to a new folder/file of your choosing

orbital has no dependencies, it should load and run without you doing anything else

## what are the controls?

enc 1 accesses menu

on menu item 1 and 3
-- btn 2 randomises selected sequence
-- enc 2 changes selected sequence pitch
-- btn 3 starts/stops playback
-- enc 3 changes selected sequence BPM (each sequence can run at its own BPM)

on menu item 2 and 4
-- enc 2 changes sequence length (each sequence can have its own number of notes)
-- enc 3 chooses note (it turns white)
-- btn 2 held plus enc 3 turned changes selected note pitch

button 2 randomises the sequence
button 3 starts/stops playback

## what is the point?

does there have to be one?

## will you do anything else to this?

yes

i want to test out more SuperCollider engines and make my own percussion engine
i want to integrate grid

orbital is a way for me to learn on simpler things while I design more complex scripts for norns and grid. it also taught me trigonometry

### what about a license?

use it, have fun with it, do whatever floats your boat

### what is a norns?

monome.org - you can read about it there
not that is really says anything useful
buy one, play, you'll figure out what norns is after you build what you want with it
